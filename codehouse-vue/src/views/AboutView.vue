    <h1>About Study 2gether</h1>
    <p>Study 2gether was created during VMWare's CodeHouse 2022 event, and is based on our collective personal experiences of finding ourselves
      being one of few women present in our STEM degrees. We wanted to create a hub where we can
      meet other women to study similar subjects together and find a community we can lean into
      for support.
